# iEEG-preprocess-using-MNE
This repository includes iEEG preprocess pipelines using MNE-python toolbox for iEEG datasets with applied stimulation.

Public datasets are processed including:

This intracranial data set is from the below publication investigating single pulse stimulation responses in the human brain:
Paulk AC, Zelmann R, Crocker B, Widge AS, Dougherty DD, Eskandar EN, et al. Local and distant cortical responses to single pulse intracranial stimulation in the human brain are differentially modulated by specific stimulation parameters. Brain Stimul 2022. 15: 15:491â€“508. Available from: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1935861X22000456

2 --> https://memory.psych.upenn.edu/RAM_Public_Data
This intracranial data set is from RESTORING ACTIVE MEMORY (RAM) project (https://memory.psych.upenn.edu/RAM) to develop a fully implantable device that can electrically stimulate the brain to improve memory function
